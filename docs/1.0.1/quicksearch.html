Our SDK makes it simple to embed code challenges and assessments into your existing products. See embeds in action We have several places you can see embeds in action: View an interactive demo here. This demo lets you see different challenges embedded right in the page, as well as see some of the events &amp; data. View a collection of example use cases. Use these to get inspired for how you can use the Embed SDK to build creative solutions to your own code testing needs. Tutorials Embedding Individual Challenges The Embed tool makes it easy to embed single code challenges in your page. This makes it possible to use Qualified for training, low-stakes testing, and other creative uses. This is the best method if you want to have more control over the experience. With this method, you can: Completely control the candidate experience, including setting the theme and controlling the workflow better. Provide inline access to practice or example challenges. Override or limit some functionality. Enable read-only or restricted editing modes. Dynamically change file contents. ➔ Embedding Challenges Embedding Full Assessments You also can embed entire assessments easily. This requires using the Qualified API to generate invitations, but provides the complete assessment experience, including Q&amp;A challenges. This is the method to use if you require any of the following: The complete assessment experience, including getting full scores &amp; playback. The full project challenge experience, including creating and moving files. Q&amp;A challenges This method also has several great features to control the experience, such as: Adjusting the workflow by hiding sidebar navigation, the welcome screen, or the review screen. Enable read-only or restricted editing modes. Hook into the assessment experience with methods to track loading, progress, and errors. It's also a good method if you don't really want to customize the experience, but just want to use Qualified Assessments inside your own page. ➔ Embedding Assessments Example Use Cases There's a list of ideas below to get you started, but you can also check out our collection of example use cases here. These examples are available as starter code to make it easy to try out some usage ideas immediately. Code Challenges An embedded challenge can be modified (or put into read-only mode), the code can be run against tests, results saved, and you can save &amp; restore the candidate's code within your own page. Some example uses include: Inline, runnable code demos. These could be used within documentation or as example educational material. Lightweight, pre-screening tests for developer applications. By capturing the response, you can use simple challenges as an intelligent sentry before letting developers continue. Inline educational practice challenges. Right alongside the training documentation, you can have editable examples that make it easy for students to master a concept. Assessment-Backed Challenges You can embed challenges backed by an assessment. This provides all the benefits of the embedded challenge above, while also creating a complete assessment result, with solutions, which is stored in Qualified. You can use these to build out complete tests of your own with one or more code challenges. Control the candidate experience more tightly, directly within your own site. Expand on the Qualified testing scenario by processing code and results in ways not currently supported within Qualified. Enable a custom solution reviewing experience by using the readonly or restricted modes. Complete Assessments If the limitations or complexity of embedding individual challenges doesn't work, we also offer embedding the entire assessment. This allows you to provide the full assessment experience, while still interacting with Qualified from your outer page. Include a complete assessment at the bottom of your education-oriented page, so the student can immediately test what they learned. Inline the pre-screen assessment experience right in your hiring page, without the delayed steps of inviting them and waiting for a response. Automatically handle responding to the submission of an assessment immediately (possibly using webhooks to determine the candidate's score).

Members invitePath :string Unique invitePath for this assessment retrieved from the AssessmentInvitation API. Note: The invite path will be modified to provide a more secure integration to the embedded assessment. If the candidate attempts to open the iframe in a new tab, it will not work as a standalone assessment. Type: string authToken :string The authToken value from an AssessmentInvitation. This token is required to enable to candidate to gain access to the embedded assessment. Type: string embedClientKey :string The unique embed client key value set on your team. Type: string baseURL :string Override the base URL for testing and debugging. Type: string mode :null|\"normal\"|\"readonly\"|\"restricted\" Enables setting up the editor in different read-only modes. null or \"normal\" The default, normal mode with full editing and saving. \"restricted\" Means you can edit the code, but changes will never be saved, or sent back to the parent window. \"readonly\" Means you cannot edit the code at all. Useful for reviewing-only, without making changes. This also disables running code. Note 1: This feature works in conjunction with the property editMode set on the assessment itself via the API. If this property is set, the embedded editor can only make the assessment more restricted, it cannot make it editable again. Note 2: If the assessment is normally editable, this feature only prevents saving changes at the client-level. It's still possible for a very clever user to make changes by accessing the API directly. It should not be considered a security feature. Type: null | \"normal\" | \"readonly\" | \"restricted\" hideSidebar :boolean The entire assessment navigation sidebar will not be shown. This also includes timer information. Not recommended unless you are planning on recreating the built-in navigation externally. Type: boolean hideWelcome :boolean If true, the welcome screen is not shown at the beginning, and the assessment is auto-started immediately upon loading. Type: boolean hideReview :boolean If true, the review screen is not shown in the sidebar. It will still be shown after submission, or if the assessment becomes non-editable (post-submission or timeout). NOTE: The assessment will not be submittable within the assessment editor! You must submit the assessment via QualifiedEmbeddedAssessment.submit(), an API call, or using timed assessments. Type: boolean Methods onLoaded(eventData) Callback for when the editor has loaded. This callback is always called at least once, and can be called multiple times. Before an assessment result is found, it will be called with started set to false. It will always be called when the assessment is ready to solve, with started set to true. Parameters: Name Type Description eventData Object Properties Name Type Description assessment QualifiedEmbeddedAssessment Embedded Assessment for this event data AssessmentOptions~LoadData Information about the assessment, will also be stored in QualifiedEmbeddedAssessment#assessmentData for future access. onUpdated(eventData) Callback whenever the assessment result is updated (active challenge changed, score updated, etc).

This is not the actual score used to evaluate the candidate. solutionId string ID of solution if we have one solutionLanguage string If a code challenge, the language being used to solve SubmissionResult Data about the submission. This is only the same data visible to the candidate, so it does not include detailed scoring or detailed results. If you want to see the actual scored results, you'll want to use the API or WebHooks to receive this data. Properties: Name Type Description assessmentId string ID of the loaded assessment assessmentResultId string ID of the current assessment result score number Current \"score\" on the assessment as seen by the candidate.

Members authToken :string The authToken value from an AssessmentInvitation. This token allows a candidate to solve an embedded challenge and save the results back as a normal assessment. This property is not used if the challenge is not storing the results back on an assessment result. Type: string embedClientKey :string The unique embed client key value set on your team. Type: string autoStart :boolean For embedded challenges with an authToken, this automatically starts the assessment and creates the solution when the embedded editor loads. When false (the default), the user will need to click a button to start the challenge. This is recommended on pages with multiple embedded challenges, otherwise start times won't be very useful. When the mode is readonly or restricted, this option is ignored. Type: boolean mode :null|\"readonly\"|\"restricted\" Enables setting up the editor in different read-only modes. null The default, normal mode with full editing and saving. \"restricted\" Means you can edit the code, but changes will never be saved, or sent back to the parent window. \"readonly\" Means you cannot edit the code at all. Useful for reviewing-only, without making changes. This also disables running code. Type: null | \"readonly\" | \"restricted\" language :string Language to use on classic code challenges. This is recommended for multi-language challenges, as the user is not provided a way to change the language within the editor. You can provide your own list of available languages using the results from the ChallengeOptions#onLoaded callback event. Type: string theme :null|\"light\"|\"dark\" Force the theme for this editor (one of light or dark). Leave unset to let the user select their own theme from the idesettings tab. Type: null | \"light\" | \"dark\" Default Value: \"light\" hideTabs :string Comma-delimited list of tabs to hide by tab ID or file path, overrides ChallengeOptions#showTabs. Type: string See: TAB_IDS for a list of common tab IDs. showTabs :string Comma-delimited list of tabs to show by tab ID or file path. When this is set, the default state is to show no tabs at all. Type: string See: TAB_IDS for a list of common tab IDs. hideActions :boolean|\"attempt\"|\"runTests\" If true, hides the list of actions in the upper left. This could be useful if you are wrapping this in your own interface. The user will still be able to run the code using the shortcut keys (CMD/CTRL + ' or CMD/CTRL + Enter). For Classic Code challenges, you can choose to only show RUN TESTS. Set the value of hideActions to \"attempt\". This hides the SUBMIT button, and disables running the code against the final submission tests. This could be useful for practice code or simple demo code. To achieve the reverse (only allowing hidden tests), either configure the challenge without Sample Test Cases, or set the value of hideActions to runTests. Simply hiding the tab will not disable the button, which could be used if you want to configure an external editor. Type: boolean | \"attempt\" | \"runTests\" Default Value: false initialLayout :Object Override the default layout for the challenge. This does not replace ChallengeOptions#hideTabs or ChallengeOptions#showTabs, which are still used to define tab visibility. Visible tabs that are not listed in initialLayout are left in their default positions. The first tab in each section will be the \"active\" tab when the editor loads. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description topLeft Array.&lt;string&gt; List of tab IDs or file paths for the top left section of the editor. Defaults to any editable files. topRight Array.&lt;string&gt; List of tab IDs or file paths for the top right section of the editor. Defaults to all other tabs. bottomLeft Array.&lt;string&gt; List of tab IDs or file paths for the bottom left section of the editor. Defaults to empty, and not recommended for smaller challenges. bottomRight Array.&lt;string&gt; List of tab IDs or file paths for the bottom right section of the editor. Defaults to empty, and not recommended for smaller challenges. See: TAB_IDS for a list of common tab IDs. initialFiles :Object Sets the initial solution values on the challenge. Note that this will only be processed when the challenge is first loaded, and if there isn't an existing solution. To change the solution content later, please use QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#setFileContents. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description (path) string Contents of each file. Use the file path as the key for project challenges, or code and testcases for classic challenges. initialCursor :ChallengeOptions~Cursor Sets the initial cursor position. Note that this will only be processed when the challenge is first loaded, and if there isn't an existing solution. To change the cursor position later, please use QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#setFileContents. Type: ChallengeOptions~Cursor initialRunResult :ChallengeOptions~RunResult Provides an initial run result, which should be the eventData.data returned from ChallengeOptions#onRun, QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#runTests, or QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#attempt. This can include the fileData property, which will configure the entire solution at once. If ChallengeOptions#initialFiles or ChallengeOptions#initialCursor are provided, they will overwrite the values in fileData. Type: ChallengeOptions~RunResult localStorageId :string If provided, automatically saves and restores the contents of the challenge in localStorage using the given id as a key. This will also restore the last cursor position. The data will automatically be serialized using the challengeId so you can use the same localStorageId value for the entire page of challenges (or even across multiple pages). Note 1: Using this feature will override anything set in ChallengeOptions#initialFiles. If you want to replace the localStorage contents, you\"ll need to call QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#setFileContents using the ChallengeOptions#onLoaded event callback. Note 2: The solution data will be stored on the domain of the parent frame, not on qualified.io. Also, the embed will never delete this data, so it is up to the outer page to manage it's localStorage. Type: string baseURL :string Override the base URL for testing and debugging. Type: string Methods onLoaded(eventData) Callback for when the editor has loaded. This callback is always called at least once, and can be called multiple times. Before a solution is created (when provided an authToken), it will be called with started set to false. It will always be called when the editor is ready to solve, with started set to true. This may be the first time it's called. It will also be called again if there are changes that affect the challenge details, such as changing the challengeId, or the solution language. Parameters: Name Type Description eventData Object Properties Name Type Description manager QualifiedEmbedManager Manager for this event editor QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge Editor for this event challengeId string Challenge ID of the editor for this event data ChallengeOptions~LoadData Information about the challenge, will also be stored in QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#challengeData for future access. onChange(eventData) Callback with changes any time an embedded challenge solution is modified. It is also called when the solution is initially set up. When the mode is readonly or restricted, this callback is not triggered. Parameters: Name Type Description eventData Object Properties Name Type Description manager QualifiedEmbedManager Manager for this event editor QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge Editor for this event challengeId string Challenge ID of the editor for this event data ChallengeOptions~FileContentsData File Change Data onRunStart(eventData) Called when a run is started (internally or externally). Note: if you want to better link run start to run results, it might be easier to use QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#runTests and QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge#attempt directly, and disable the internal buttons. This allows you to link the start with the result, as those methods return a promise on completion.

Note that the outer page will not be able to interact with the embedded challenge. This could, however, be useful as a way to show simple examples with static site generators. The base URL will be https://www.qualified.io/embed/[challengeId]. The following parameters are supported to be set via query parameters for simple embedding. For example, if you'd like to inject a javascript challenge with dark-mode, you might use the following code: &lt;iframe src=\"https://www.qualified.io/embed/abcd12340001?language=javascript&amp;theme=dark\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; Members mode :undefined|\"readonly\"|\"restricted\" Enables setting up the editor in different read-only modes. null The default, normal mode with full editing and saving. \"restricted\" Means you can edit the code, but changes will never be saved, or sent back to the parent window. \"readonly\" Means you cannot edit the code at all. Useful for reviewing-only, without making changes. This also disables running code. Type: undefined | \"readonly\" | \"restricted\" language :string Language to use on classic code challenges. This is recommended for multi-language challenges, as the user is not provided a way to change the language within the editor. You can provide your own list of available languages using the results from the ChallengeOptions#onLoaded callback event. Type: string theme :\"light\"|\"dark\" Force the theme for this editor (one of light or dark). Leave unset to let the user select their own theme from the idesettings tab. Type: \"light\" | \"dark\" Default Value: \"light\" hideTabs :string Comma-delimited list of tabs to hide by tab ID or file path, overrides ChallengeOptions#showTabs. Type: string See: TAB_IDS for a list of common tab IDs. showTabs :string Comma-delimited list of tabs to show by tab ID or file path. When this is set, the default state is to show no tabs at all. Type: string See: TAB_IDS for a list of common tab IDs. hideActions :boolean|\"attempt\" If true, hides the list of actions in the upper left. This could be useful if you are wrapping this in your own interface. The user will still be able to run the code using the shortcut keys (CMD/CTRL + ' or CMD/CTRL + Enter). For Classic Code challenges, you can choose to only show RUN TESTS. Set the value of hideActions to \"attempt\". This hides the SUBMIT button, and disables running the code against the final submission tests. This could be useful for practice code or simple demo code. To achieve the reverse (only allowing hidden tests), either configure the challenge without Sample Test Cases, or hide the testcases tab using hideTabs.

This makes it easy to fully test candidates and students without them leaving your site. You should embed the full assessment whenever you need the following: The complete assessment experience, including getting full scores &amp; playback. The full project challenge experience, including creating and moving files.

This provides you with the unique invitePath and authToken properties needed to load the assessment. Then simply create a new QualifiedEmbeddedAssessment with a DOM node and those properties, the assessment will be loaded into your page automatically. Configuration Details There are a few options you can use to customize the assessment editor, as well as interact with the editor directly. Below will highlight some of the more useful options. A complete list of options is available in AssessmentOptions. Example Appearance Options These options will help you configure the style and visible components of the editor. mode can be set to readonly or restricted to change how editing and saving works. hideSidebar can be used to completely hide the built-in navigation sidebar. If you do this, you may want to provide external controls for challenge navigation. However, the internal challenge buttons will allow the candidate to move forward to the next challenge and through to submission (but never backwards to a previous one). Also note this hides the timer. On timed assessments, this means you'll need to provide your own external timer. You can use startedAt, timeLimit, and cutOffTime from onLoaded to create an external timer. hideWelcome can be used to immediately start a candidate on the assessment. This also hides any welcome screen information, such as navigation and timer information. Callbacks The embedded editor provides several callbacks throughout its lifecycle. Click on any callback for details. onLoaded() is called after the assessment editor has been loaded. It can be used to learn more about the assessment. onUpdated() is called whenever there is an update to the assessment result, including events that affect score &amp; completion information. onSolutionUpdated() is called as challenges are changed and solutions are modified. onSubmitted() is called once the entire assessment has been submitted. onError() is called for unrecoverable error events, such as network errors or permissions errors. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-challenges.html":{"id":"tutorial-challenges.html","title":"Tutorial: Embedding Challenges","body":" Qualified Embed SDK Classes QualifiedEmbeddedAssessmentQualifiedEmbeddedChallengeQualifiedEmbedManager Interfaces AssessmentOptionsChallengeOptionsUrlParams Tutorials Embedding AssessmentsEmbedding Challenges Global ERROR_CONTEXTS_getStorageData_setStorageDataobfuscateIddeobfuscateId_checkDestroyedTAB_IDS Embedding Challenges Embedding challenges allows you to show one or more challenges on a page. These are great for education &amp; training, but can also be used for quick, low-stakes tests. When embedding challenges, you can: Completely control the candidate experience, including setting the theme and controlling the workflow better. Provide inline access to practice or example challenges. Override or limit some functionality. Enable read-only or restricted editing modes. Dynamically change file contents.

Public Means using individual challenges with the embeddable flag set. These challenges will not save solutions back to the Qualified service. This mode lets you build your own system around individual challenges. Authenticated Means inviting a user using the AssessmentInvitations API, and supplying an authToken to have the candidate take the embedded challenge similar to a full assessment. You can mix both techniques in the same page, within the same manager. This can be useful for including practice or example challenges within a larger assessment. Embedded Challenge Limitations The Embed editor is not intended as a 1-to-1 replacement for the dedicated assessment suite. Several features are not available within the embedded app at this time, including: Time-Limits are not shown or enforced, either for whole assessments or for individual challenges. If you need to enforce time limits, you should manage them within your application. Quiz Challenges are not currently supported at all. Project Code Challenges are presented in a limited format: Candidates are not able to add, rename, or delete files. There is no file tree. The editor also only shows editable (readwrite) files to the candidate. External IDE is not supported. For Assessments, your system will be required to mark the assessment as submitted for complete scoring. If any of the above are necessary for your use case, try embedding full assessments instead. Initial Setup For configuring group of challenges, please use init on window.QualifiedEmbed.QualifiedEmbedManager. Once you've set up your manager, you can create individual embeds using QualifiedEmbedManager#createEditor. See QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge for the editor functions. Direct Challenge Creation If you only plan on using a single challenge, and want to control the creation and removal of that challenge through code, you can also create an embedded challenge directly: const editor = new window.QualifiedEmbed.QualifiedEmbeddedChallenge({ node: iframeNode, challengeId: \"507f19cde860e19729a1e810\", options: { embedClientKey: embedClientKeyFromTeamSettings, theme: \"dark\", language: \"javascript\", }, }); Note that this method doesn't allow the use of autoCreate. Simple Embedding If you do not need to interact with the challenge, you can directly embed an iframe and configure some options via the URL. This could be used for static site generators, where you might not have easy access to injecting the embed library. To learn more about this, see the UrlParams page. Configuration Details The Embed SDK includes a lot of functionality to fine-tune your embeds. Options can be set on the manager (for shared options across all embeds), and further customized on each editor individually. Below will highlight some of the more useful options. A complete list of options is available in ChallengeOptions. Example Appearance Options These options will help you configure the style and visible components of the editor. mode can be set to readonly or restricted to change how editing and saving works. theme can be forced to be one of light (default) or dark. If you don't set the theme, the user can change the theme in the idesettings tab, and it will sync across embeds. hideTabs and showTabs can be used to hide challenge tabs you do not want, such as instructions or idesettings. See TAB_IDS for common tab names. hideActions can be set to true if you want to wrap the Qualified editor with your own custom controls. initialLayout is an advanced option that lets you configure exactly where each editor tab shows up. Example Challenge Content Options These options will help you set up the challenge correctly. language is used to set the language on multi-language classic code challenges. initialFiles is used to override the contents of the files used within the challenge. localStorageId can be set to automatically back up and restore the editor's contents within the browser's localStorage. Callbacks The embedded editor provides several callbacks throughout its lifecycle. Click on any callback for details. onLoaded() is called once after the challenge is loaded. It includes information about the loaded challenge. onChange() is called every time the editor's contents change (debounced to prevent too much noise). Use this to build a custom save/restore along with initialFiles. onRunStart() is called at the start of any run of the code. onRun() is called after every completed run of the code. It includes a lot of detailed information about the run results. × Search results Close "}}
